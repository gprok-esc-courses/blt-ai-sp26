Be careful ,1,"Be careful! I accidentally put in the wrong date of delivery, 2 month to specific. Called the customer support, to ask if the can change it because there's (from writing this)over 15 days before it needs to be delivered. They told me that they couldn't change it because it was already printing... I can not see how the fact that is printing, has anything to do with the delivery, when the delivery is so far out. I would say that they simply do not care! And now I need to spend x amount of € again. I don't think I will be using this site again.Update! After a shot email this is the answer they give.Hi Rasmus, this is Obienda from Greetz. Thank you so much for providing your order number. I’ve checked it for you, and unfortunately, we’re unable to change the delivery date at this time. I’m really sorry for any inconvenience this may cause. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or need further assistance. Wishing you a wonderful day!From writing this, there's still 18 days to before the gift needed to be delivered... If I could I would give them -5 out of 5 stars "
Great selection and easy gift ordering…,5,Great selection and easy gift ordering whilst living overseas
Flowers were 5 days late and they kept…,1,"Flowers were 5 days late and they kept pestering me about pictures, for which I had to bother a sick person (the one I send the flowers to). what do you think flowers look like, 5 days late???! Mid question about this late delivery on the chat the AI bot said “we are closed now” (!) AI is 24/7! No communication about refund only the message that the amount of the flowers will be refunded and that’s it. I do not agree, I deserve full refund but all’s quiet now.  This will be my very last order ever. always something with these guys. and the helpdesk is worse everytime."
Never  trust them  very bad service,1,"Im very sorry that I trust them , I order 2 gifts with Card  for same person for the birthday , they deliver only one , I spend my day for searching and calling  without any result.The Gifts cost expensive amount  plus they take much money for the delivery  , in the end my friend received only a ballon and it was without name or Catd. My advise do not shop from them     Expensive Not honestBad service"
Love Greetz ,5,"I always send cards with Greetz. Good choise, quick delivery. I only had one card that was not on time, from all the cards I send. So I am very pleased with Greetz "
Order 6 weeks in advance when shipping…,3,Order 6 weeks in advance when shipping to Australia. A simple card takes way too long to get delivered so you need to plan that 2 months in advance unfortunately.
Always on time and personal service,5,"Always on time and personal service, very happy with Greetz!"
My order was send to 7 adresses,1,"My order was send to 7 adresses, after paying it was only one adress. I chat immediatly but they couldnt change or cancel my order. they even told me that I ordered at 08.00 but it was 12.28...such a bad experience today, so unflexible, they told me to call on Monday...sure...on monday al is send out.."
Sent a birthday day for my friend from…,1,"Sent a birthday day for my friend from England. Used the greetz the Dutch moonpig. Part of the wider group. Says they used their local post doesn’t deliver on the birthday. Doesn’t respond to emails and complaints via email, however happy to spam my email account 3 times everyday with sales pitches and discount codes than respond to my complaint. Spent over 60 euros no emails response or call back.  Looped in their parent company in my complaint still no response either so left with no choice but to raise a credit card claim back. Long story short not cards or gift delivered. Also heard from friends in the Netherlands they are a nightmare to deal with. Don’t bother wasting your time. Just spam you email offers every second until you unsubscribe. And don’t respond to complaints."
Order not received ,2,"I ordered flowers, chocolates and a card well ahead of my sister's birthday.  The flowers arrived but no chocolates or card even though I'd received an email  that they'd  been delivered.  My sister had no idea who the flowers were from and it turned into a disappointing  experience.  I immediately contacted  Greetz via email but have not had any response,  not even an acknowledgement of the email. Extremely upsetting "
It's simply easy with a great offer,5,It's simply easy with a great offer. Even an order placed on Saturday will be delivered on Sunday. 
A big variation on cards; a bit annoying with there mailings,3,"Greetz cards are of big variation, payable and clear. But the multiple emails you get when someones birthday enters is very annoying. Of course you can sign out for that but then you are signed out for every mailing. It's all or nothing."
"Good service, bit pushy",4,"I like their service and product, but they are a little bit pushy on the emails"
Great service👏,5,"Great service👏Just like to see the card before its delivered, is that pissible?"
